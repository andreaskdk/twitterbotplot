In this directory Twitter API access credentials should be stored. A total of four files should be created each containing just one line with the relevant token. The four files should be called:

* accesstoken
* accesstokensecret
* consumerkey
* consumersecret

To get access to the Twitter API follow the instructions on [this page](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
